# 📋 Saviynt Demo App - Project Overview

## What Is This?

The Saviynt Demo App is a fully functional task management web application specifically designed to demonstrate **Saviynt's Agentic Web App Onboarding** capability. It showcases how Saviynt can automatically discover, understand, and manage web applications that don't have traditional REST APIs.

## Purpose

This application serves as a **test target** for Saviynt's agentic capabilities by providing:
- A realistic web application with user management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Standard web forms for user CRUD operations
- Multiple user roles with different permissions
- A modern, professional UI that's easy to navigate

## Key Features

### 👥 User Management
- **Create Users**: Add new users with profile information. A default password (`changeme123456789change`) is automatically assigned at creation — no password entry required during the create flow.
- **Update Users**: Modify user details, status, and roles
- **Delete Users**: Remove users from the system
- **Activate/Deactivate**: Enable or disable user access
- **Password Management**: Reset user passwords manually after creation via the Reset Password action
- **Organizational Hierarchy**: Assign managers to users

### 🔐 Role-Based Access Control
Four predefined roles demonstrating different access levels:

1. **Administrator**
   - Full system access
   - User and role management
   - View all tasks
   - System configuration

2. **Sales Manager**
   - View and manage team tasks
   - Create tasks for team members
   - Limited administrative access
   - Team performance dashboard

3. **Sales User**
   - Create and manage own tasks
   - View assigned tasks
   - Update task status
   - Basic dashboard access

4. **Reporting User**
   - Read-only access to dashboards
   - View reports and analytics
   - No modification permissions

### 📊 Task Management
- Create tasks with descriptions and metadata
- Assign tasks to users
- Set priorities (Low, Medium, High)
- Track status (Open, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled)
- Set due dates
- Filter and sort tasks
- Role-based task visibility

### 🎨 Modern User Interface
- Clean, professional design
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- Intuitive navigation
- Color-coded status indicators
- Real-time dashboard statistics
- Easy-to-read tables and forms

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite (file-based, portable)
- **Templates**: EJS (server-side rendering)
- **Authentication**: Session-based with bcrypt
- **Styling**: Custom CSS (Tailwind-inspired)

### Why These Technologies?

1. **SQLite**: 
   - No separate database server required
   - Perfect for demos and portability
   - Easy to backup and reset

2. **Server-Side Rendering**:
   - Pages are easily scrapeable by Saviynt's agent
   - No complex JavaScript frameworks
   - Standard HTML forms

3. **Express**:
   - Lightweight and fast
   - Well-documented
   - Large ecosystem

4. **Session-Based Auth**:
   - Traditional login flow
   - Cookie-based sessions
   - Demonstrates standard auth patterns

## How Saviynt Can Use This App

### Discovery Phase
1. Saviynt's agent navigates to the login page
2. Identifies form fields (username, password)
3. Detects authentication mechanism
4. Maps application structure

### User Management Phase
1. Logs in as administrator
2. Navigates to user management section
3. Identifies user list table
4. Maps create/edit/delete actions
5. Detects form fields and validation

### Role Assignment Phase
1. Discovers available roles
2. Maps role assignment interface
3. Tests role modification
4. Validates permission changes

### Integration Phase
1. Automates user provisioning
2. Manages role assignments
3. Monitors user status
4. Handles deprovisioning

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Onboarding
1. Saviynt receives onboarding request
2. Logs into demo app as admin
3. Navigates to "Create User"
4. Fills in user details (no password required — default is auto-assigned)
5. Assigns appropriate role
6. Confirms user creation
7. Optionally resets password via the Reset Password action

### Scenario 2: Role Change
1. Access certification review triggers role change
2. Saviynt logs in
3. Finds user in user management
4. Updates role assignment
5. Verifies change applied

### Scenario 3: User Deactivation
1. Termination workflow initiated
2. Saviynt accesses app
3. Locates user account
4. Changes status to "Inactive"
5. Confirms deactivation

### Scenario 4: Access Review
1. Review campaign started
2. Saviynt logs in as reviewer
3. Navigates through user list
4. Extracts current roles
5. Provides review data

- Add monitoring
- Set up backups

## Success Metrics

How to know it's working:

✅ Application starts without errors  
✅ Login page loads  
✅ Can log in with demo credentials  
✅ Dashboard displays data  
✅ Can create/edit users (as admin)  
✅ Can create/edit tasks  
✅ Role permissions work correctly  
✅ Data persists after restart  

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Can't install dependencies**
   - Check Node.js version (18+)
   - Clear npm cache
   - Check internet connection

2. **Port 3000 already in use**
   - Use different port: `PORT=3001 npm start`
   - Kill process using port 3000

3. **Database errors**
   - Delete data/database.sqlite
   - Run npm run reset

4. **Permission denied**
   - Check file permissions
   - Run with appropriate user
